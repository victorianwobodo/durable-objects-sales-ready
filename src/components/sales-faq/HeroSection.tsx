          Modern applications need real-time coordination, but traditional databases and caching layers create bottlenecks, 
          increase costs, and fail at scale. Companies waste months building complex infrastructure just to handle 
          collaborative features, live updates, and stateful interactions. Durable Objects eliminate this complexity 
          by providing instant, globally-distributed state management that scales automaticallyâ€”letting your customers 
          focus on building features that drive revenue, not wrestling with infrastructure.
